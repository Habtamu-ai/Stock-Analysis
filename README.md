# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyse the entire stock market over the last few years and to Identify which VBA script run faster.
.
## Results
By refactoring the original *green stock _macro*  we managed to analyse the entire stock market in 2017 and 2018. We find **ENPH** and **RUN** has registered 81.9% and 84% positive return in 2018. While the others stock return is negative.In addition, we find a positive retun for all tickers in 2017 except **TERP** which is a loss of 7.2%.

Our VBA script also run faster than the previous green stock analysis. we find a huge improvment regards to the time that takes to run the code and provinde a result. If we compare *Image 1* and *Image 2* we can see the an improvment from **1.73** seconds to **0.166** seconds.Looking at *Image 3 and4*, we also can see the improvment we get by refactoring the VBA codes.

## Summary
In general, refactoring might give us an advantage of having a clean, organized and quality code. On the contrary, we might risk our time and money by trying to refactor someone’s code, specially if we don’t know what it is all about.
In our analysis refactoring the VBA code helped us a lot. Looking at the screenshots, the stock analysis in 2017 and 2018  run in 0.167 and 0.166 respectively. While the
